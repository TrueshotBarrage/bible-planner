# Bible Planner
Generate a Bible reading plan to your liking! This project makes it possible to generate a reading plan 
from simply three things: 
- A list of books of the Bible 
- The duration
- The start date

Clone the project, modify the `config.json` file with your desired settings, and generate your own custom Bible reading plan. 
Some examples are provided in the `samples` directory.
